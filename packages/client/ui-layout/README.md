## Summary

This package provides the Web GUI's AppFrame with sidebar, main content, an optional product shelf, and a right-panel track. The shelf concedes width before the right panel to protect the center; the shelf stays available for book navigation. Products can supply a titlebar. The theme presenter owns color scheme, alias tokens, content font size, and document metadata. Layout state resets on reload.

## Use this package

Products register `shelf` and `titlebar` alongside the standard columns; absent occupants leave those regions empty. The shelf opens at 300px and resizes up to 1040px; its subtree stays mounted when closed. The sidebar spans 264–420px, defaults to 280px, and retains a 56px collapsed rail. Below 1024px it collapses automatically, and opening the right panel collapses a manually expanded sidebar. The right panel first opens at 45% of the viewport, retains the user's pixel preference, and caps at 70%. The frame concedes shelf width first, then reduces or closes the right track to protect 400px for the center. Dragging has no transition delay; the right handle is absent while closed or fullscreen.

Global panels occupy the root-scoped `main` keyed slot; `conversation` is the reserved key for the Conversation. `ctx.layout.selectPanel(id)` selects a registered panel, and `null` selects the Conversation without changing the current Session. No global panel is registered by the shipped composition.

### Window-chrome seat

On macOS desktop (`html[data-platform='darwin']`, set only by the desktop preload) a collapsed sidebar hides its column entirely instead of keeping the rail, and the frame mounts the single root-scoped `shell.leading` seat at its top-left — beside the hiddenInset traffic lights, over every main panel; ui-sidebar occupies it with the reopen and New Session controls. While the seat is mounted the frame publishes `--dsh-frame-leading-clearance`, the inline band the window chrome occupies measured from the frame's left edge; a main panel whose content reaches the top-left corner pads by it so nothing lands under the lights or the controls. The frame also always publishes `--dsh-frame-top-clearance` (48px) on the root element, the constant step below the window's top strip; entry pages in the main panel (plugin manager and similar, not the conversation) pad their top by it, and overlay primitives (portal menus, bottom-anchored overlays, the settings panel) keep it as their top viewport margin — the root-element home lets overlays portalled to `document.body` read it too. The full-width window drag band is 52px; while the Conversation is selected and its header shows the view tab strip, the band deepens to the 76px header block (title row plus tab strip), so blank header space drags while header controls stay clickable.

Windows Electron's `data-windows-titlebar` marker reserves the caption height above all columns and removes the collapsed sidebar rail. Only the content area's top-left corner has a 16px radius; the other corners and the internal divider remain square. The frame publishes `--dsh-windows-content-radius` and `--dsh-windows-sidebar-width` for ui-sidebar-right's fullscreen corner and sidebar clearance. Ordinary Web documents do not receive the marker; macOS retains its separate layout.

### Theme presentation

The presenter consumes resolved theme snapshots and projects them onto the document: `html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens and `--dsh-content-font-size` as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background. Disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

`selectPanel(id)` checks the live `main` registry before changing selection; an absent key throws and leaves the current panel intact. `beginNavigation()` returns an abort signal for an asynchronous UI navigation. A later call, a valid panel selection (including repeated selection), or layout disposal aborts that signal without cancelling underlying Session creation. Consumers check the signal before committing navigation or moving drafts.

One registration declares six child slots and binds `ctx.layout` methods `selectPanel`, `toggleSidebar`, `openRightbar(track, fullscreen)`, and `closeRightbar`. One root store separates `panelInfo` selection from `layoutInfo` measurements, width preferences, and presentation reports. `usePanelInfo` subscribes to the stable selection object; AppFrame subscribes to the stable layout object. The `rightbar` owner supplies actual `width`, `viewportWidth`, and normal-presentation eligibility `canShow`; insufficient room causes a deterministic close, never automatic reopening on widening. Fullscreen hides the width handle without releasing a track the occupant retains. AppFrame keeps the column containers mounted. The right column's root controller renders `rightbar.session` through `SessionProvider` only while the Conversation is selected; its unmount report releases the track. The independent title component uses the selected Session title only while the Conversation is visible, with the build-configured product title or localized `common.brand.localBuild` as its fallback; locale revisions update that fallback. The theme presenter is a second effect: pure DOM writes from resolved snapshots — initial state through the getter once, then event-driven only, with no React path. It applies palette, font-size, and token variables before measuring the rendered background as the single color authority. Fullscreen presentation suppresses grid and handle transitions; its occupant reports the new columns only after covering the frame. Fullscreen exit keeps transitions suppressed while the frame installs its destination geometry: close removes the right track, and restore retains it. Subsequent normal geometry actions restore ordinary transitions. The independent shelf uses its own width preference and collapse state, and `titlebar` receives product window controls.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the layout surface is not enough. They move from the frame to the columns it renders and the theme it presents.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — occupies the `sidebar` column and its seats.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — occupies the `main` key `conversation`.
- [ui-sidebar-right](../ui-sidebar-right/README.md) — occupies the `rightbar` column with one docking surface per session.
- [ui-theme](../ui-theme/README.md) — the theme seam whose resolved snapshots the presenter consumes.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current layout behavior. They are current package constraints, not a general window-manager comparison or a task backlog.

- **Panel geometry is transient** — reload restores the sidebar default and the right panel hidden; each dragged width is one frame-wide preference, not a per-Session fact.
- **Extremely narrow windows** — after the right panel closes, the center may still fall below 400px; the left 56px rail remains.
- **Track and panel travel on one shared curve** — the frame's track transition and the occupant's slide read the same duration and easing variables; an occupant that used its own would detach the panel's edge from the conversation's while squeezing.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The shell viewing-state store behind `ctx.layout` emits no Cordis events; clamp and track sequencing is asserted directly by this package's columns and service specs.
